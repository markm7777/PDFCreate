# PDFCreate
Create PDF using pdfkit

This is just a simple React app for entering report data and using [PdfKit](https://pdfkit.org/) to create a pdf from that data. 
It is based on [pdfkit-react-example](https://github.com/sturtevant/pdfkit-react-example), which is bootstrapped by [react-app-rewired](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-app-rewired) (a 'semi-ejected'? version of [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app)).
